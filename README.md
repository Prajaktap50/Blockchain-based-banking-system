blockchain based banking system
<h3>Introduction-</h3>
All the executed bitcoin transactions are considered to be a public ledger in the Blockchain technology. 

The records of transactions made in Bitcoin or other crypto-currency are stored in blocks and maintained across all the computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. 

A Blockchain is the “current” part of a Blockchain which records some or all of the recent transactions, and once completed, goes into the Blockchain as a permanent database. 

Each time a new block is generated based on the completion of each block. 



Problem Statement-Traditional banking systems struggle with security, transparency, and efficiency, which a blockchain-based  banking system aims to resolve using blockchain technology.
